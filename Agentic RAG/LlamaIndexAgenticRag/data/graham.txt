Model Compatibility: Ensure that the model ‘llama3-70b-8192’ is compatible with the function you’re trying to use. Some models may have limitations on certain APIs.
API Key: Make sure you have set your API key for Groq correctly. You can create an API key at the Groq console and set it as an environment variable (e.g., export GROQ_API_KEY=<your_api_key>). Alternatively, you can pass your API key directly when initializing the LLM (Llama Language Model)2.
Rate Limits: If you’re consistently getting rate limit errors, consider reducing the number of requests you’re making, increasing the delay between requests, or upgrading to a paid tier of the OpenAI API if your usage exceeds the free tier limits3.
